# React Advanced & Custom Hooks

## Objectives

- [ ] Implement `useRef` in a React component & discuss situations when it's useful
- [ ] Create a custom hook `useForm`
- [ ] explore the `useContext` hook for giving access to information anywhere in the component hierarchy

## Deliverables for Project Showcase

- Bring the name input into focus when visiting `/projects/new`
- Add a custom hook `useForm` to extract repetitive code from `ProjectForm` component so it can be used in other form components as well.
- Add a custom hook `useDocumentTitle` that will allow us to change the document title within the components that are rendered by React Router routes (so we don't see React App as the title on every page) 

## Agenda

- Build features for project showcase
- explore the useContext hook
- do a bit of custom hooks workshop
